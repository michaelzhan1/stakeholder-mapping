# Stakeholder Mapping Tool

This tool is a website built on Next.js and React, intended to identify stakeholders from user-input documents and generate a graph of coalitions between stakeholders.

## Running the Tool Locally
First, make sure you have `npm` installed (link [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)). Then, install the node packages locally by running the following command within the project root.
```bash
npm install
```

Once packages are installed, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
